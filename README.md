# module-02-challenge

## Description

This webpage is my week 2 bootcamp challenge. I created this webpage from scratch with no starter code, and it will be used as my portfolio to showcase my work. I broadened my knowledge of flexbox, css variables, semantic elements, linking external sites and images, etc. This is something that I will utilize and improve upon in the future as I continue to learn.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage
This webpage contains information about myself, Madeline Lowes, and supporting links to external pages and images. Explore each element to see where they'll take you.
